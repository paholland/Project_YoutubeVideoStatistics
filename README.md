### Project_YoutubeVideoStatistics. This repository is for our group project. 

    This project uses various techniques for data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and analysis of relationship.
    
Used Pandas to clean and format the dataset.
Created a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
Created a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis.
Used Matplotlib to create a total of 6–8 visualizations of the data.
Saved PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in the presentation.
Used API (found an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions).
Created a write-up summarizing major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” asked of the data and
a short description of the findings and any relevant plots.
Presentation Requirements:

Questions you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them
Where and how the data was found to answer these questions
The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by Jupyter Notebook)
The analysis process (accompanied by Jupyter Notebook)
Conclusions, which should include a numerical summary and visualizations of that summary
The implications of the findings: what do they findings mean?
